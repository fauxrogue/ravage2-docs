# Bake Operators

---

## Export

The Export bake operator is used to output the data from the different layers
on the different channels.

## High Poly

The High Poly bake operator is used to bake normal map details from a high
polygonal object to a low polygonal object. This is especially useful for users
working in the game industry.

## ID Map

The ID Map bake operator is used to create masks from the different vertex
groups or material slots.

## Support Map

The Support Map bake operator is used to create maps from the provided geometry
that will then be used for the baking process. For some generator masks such as
the edge wear generator, you will need to bake support maps to use it.
